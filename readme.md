# Info


**Please make sure to use node 7.8+, since the implementation uses async/await ((good bye co/yield ;-]**

Procedure shall be straightforwad:

```npm install```

Then:

```node app.js```

Will run service on 3000 port on HTTP.


To run tests:

```npm test```

Tests were done using supertest, so not a typical unit tests, but for such simple service I think it is enough to combine sort-of API tests with unit tests (otherwise, users module shall have their own suite of unit tests).

Coding style taken from AirBnB-base.

## Authorization

Own solution taken, with the concept that session ID (UUID v.4) is passed by logged in client in custom header. Persistence for users made with scanning ./users/*.json files for registered ones. No persistence for logged in users. This could be achieved with redirecting client to /login instead of 403 on /search endpoint.

# Task description

# Part 1. User Service

The assignment is to create a User Service Express API that allow users to register, login, logout and query others. No dedicated database should be used, each user will be stored in separate JSON file (named uuid.json) in users directory.

## `/user/` API


### - POST /user/register
```
  {
  name: "Edsger W. Dijkstra",
  email: "dijkstra@utexas.edu",
  luckyNumber: 42,
  password: "ipdPza9szGWMKgVA"
  }
```
If email and lucky number are unique user should be stored in a file `88771a2c-1ec1-11e7-93ae-92361f002671.json` (itâ€™s just an example) located in users/ directory.


### - PUT /user/logout


### - POST /user/login

JWT or node authentication with passport npm package can be used here. 
```
  {
  email: "dijkstra@utexas.edu",
  password: "ipdPza9szGWMKgVA"
  }
```

### - POST /user/search

This post is available only for authenticated users. 
```
  {
  query: ".edu"
  }
```

### - POST /user/search RESPONSE

Expected response is an array of users that email or name matches given query. 
```

  name: "Edsger W. Dijkstra",
